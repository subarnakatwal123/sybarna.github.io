                Starting with nothing but an old laptop and a strong resolve, he taught himself the fundamentals of digital security, 
                often facing power cuts, limited resources, and endless nights of coding and reading. Every challenge only strengthened 
                his determination to carve out a meaningful role in this field.

                world a safer place. He has mastered skills in ethical hacking, cloud security, and network defense, though he knows his journey 
                is just beginning. With unwavering resilience, he continues to push his limits, turning setbacks into setups for success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subarna’s journey is one of grit and passion—a story of learning from every setback and looking forward to a bright future. He believes 
                that, with dedication, he can bring value to the field and make an impact. A future in cybersecurity awaits him, where he’ll be 
                contributing to a safer online space for everyone.
